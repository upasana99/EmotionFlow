speaker	All right .	no_emotion
speaker	So , what do we do now ?	no_emotion

speaker	Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?	surprise
speaker	We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .	no_emotion
speaker	I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .	no_emotion
speaker	It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .	no_emotion
speaker	Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .	no_emotion

speaker	Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?	no_emotion
speaker	That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .	no_emotion
speaker	We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?	no_emotion
speaker	That sounds good .	no_emotion
speaker	Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?	no_emotion
speaker	Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .	no_emotion
speaker	4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .	no_emotion
speaker	Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .	no_emotion
speaker	You mean to saya	no_emotion
speaker	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?	no_emotion

I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy .

I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future .

speaker	Why is the car before us stopping ?	no_emotion
speaker	What's going on ?	no_emotion
speaker	Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .	no_emotion
speaker	More and more people easily get irritated while driving .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . This is what is called road rage .	no_emotion

speaker	This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .	no_emotion

speaker	This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?	no_emotion
speaker	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .	no_emotion
speaker	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .	no_emotion
speaker	The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...	no_emotion
speaker	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .	no_emotion
speaker	That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .	no_emotion
speaker	What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !	happiness

speaker	Hi , my name is Tom .	no_emotion
speaker	Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .	no_emotion
speaker	Nice to meet you too.Melinda .	no_emotion
speaker	Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .	no_emotion
speaker	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .	surprise
speaker	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .	no_emotion
speaker	It looks like you guys work hard .	no_emotion
speaker	I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .	no_emotion
speaker	Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .	no_emotion
speaker	Sure thing .	no_emotion

speaker	What do you think of our price ?	no_emotion
speaker	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .	no_emotion
speaker	I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .	no_emotion
speaker	Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?	no_emotion
speaker	We've already cut down our price to cost level .	no_emotion
speaker	Is that all ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , this is the best we can do .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .	no_emotion

speaker	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?	no_emotion
speaker	It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .	happiness
speaker	Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?	no_emotion
speaker	You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .	no_emotion
speaker	But what if I need my money suddenly ?	no_emotion
speaker	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .	no_emotion
speaker	Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !	no_emotion
speaker	Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot	no_emotion
speaker	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .	happiness

speaker	Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?	no_emotion
speaker	Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .	no_emotion
speaker	Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?	no_emotion
speaker	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .	no_emotion
speaker	Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?	no_emotion
speaker	All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .	no_emotion
speaker	Okay , that's good . I get it .	happiness

speaker	Kate , you never believe what's happened .	surprise
speaker	What do you mean ?	no_emotion
speaker	Masha and Hero are getting divorced .	no_emotion
speaker	You are kidding . What happened ?	surprise
speaker	Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .	no_emotion
speaker	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?	surprise
speaker	Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .	no_emotion
speaker	That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?	no_emotion
speaker	Early in the New Year I guess .	no_emotion

speaker	Yes . Can I help you ?	no_emotion
speaker	Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .	no_emotion
speaker	Of course I remember you .	no_emotion
speaker	I think I lost my wallet here .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .	surprise

speaker	No . My friend did .	no_emotion
speaker	Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .	no_emotion
speaker	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .	no_emotion
speaker	Should I call the police ?	no_emotion
speaker	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .	no_emotion
speaker	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .	no_emotion
speaker	Thanks for your help .	no_emotion

speaker	I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . But why should you want to do that ?	no_emotion
speaker	Do you mind if I speak frankly ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not at all . Go ahead .	no_emotion
speaker	Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .	no_emotion

speaker	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .	no_emotion
speaker	It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .	no_emotion
speaker	You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .	no_emotion
speaker	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .	no_emotion
speaker	Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .	no_emotion
speaker	To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .	no_emotion
speaker	Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .	no_emotion
speaker	It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .	no_emotion

speaker	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !	anger
speaker	I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .	no_emotion
speaker	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !	anger
speaker	I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?	no_emotion
speaker	I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?	no_emotion
speaker	I don't know .	no_emotion
speaker	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .	no_emotion
speaker	What do you mean ?	no_emotion
speaker	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .	no_emotion
speaker	I have plenty of gas .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .	no_emotion
speaker	So what can we do ?	no_emotion
speaker	Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .	no_emotion
speaker	Alright . That's a good idea .	happiness
speaker	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .	no_emotion
speaker	Days ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .	surprise

speaker	I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .	no_emotion
speaker	That's nice .	no_emotion
speaker	We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .	no_emotion

speaker	I would like to purchase some meat .	no_emotion

speaker	I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .	no_emotion
speaker	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .	surprise
speaker	Do you sell direct to shops ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .	no_emotion
speaker	Do you keep a stock of these things ?	no_emotion
speaker	In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .	no_emotion
speaker	That is , your commission .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .	no_emotion
speaker	Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .	no_emotion
speaker	The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .	no_emotion
speaker	According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?	no_emotion
speaker	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .	no_emotion
speaker	We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...	no_emotion
speaker	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?	no_emotion
speaker	Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .	no_emotion
speaker	Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .	no_emotion
speaker	All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .	no_emotion
speaker	Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .	no_emotion

speaker	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?	no_emotion
speaker	We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	no_emotion
speaker	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .	no_emotion

speaker	Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .	no_emotion
speaker	From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .	no_emotion
speaker	I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?	no_emotion
speaker	Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,	no_emotion
speaker	So who has to stay behind ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .	no_emotion

speaker	How does the political system work in your country ?	no_emotion

speaker	Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?	no_emotion

speaker	Do you mind if I go with you ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .	no_emotion

speaker	What happened ?	no_emotion

speaker	Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .	no_emotion
speaker	But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .	no_emotion
speaker	More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .	no_emotion
speaker	Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?	no_emotion
speaker	It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .	no_emotion

speaker	Can any unit see my information ?	no_emotion
speaker	It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .	no_emotion
speaker	Which websites offer this service ?	no_emotion

speaker	Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .	no_emotion
speaker	I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok .	no_emotion
speaker	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes .	no_emotion
speaker	Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .	no_emotion
speaker	I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok , thanks doctor .	no_emotion

speaker	Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?	no_emotion
speaker	Sure , please hold on .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	no_emotion
speaker	Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .	no_emotion
speaker	You are so kind , you helped me a lot .	happiness
speaker	You are welcome . Bye !	happiness

speaker	Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?	no_emotion
speaker	Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .	no_emotion
speaker	Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm afraid so , yes .	no_emotion
speaker	Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .	no_emotion
speaker	What do you recommend we do ?	no_emotion
speaker	I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .	no_emotion
speaker	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .	no_emotion

speaker	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	no_emotion
speaker	You should go to the dentist .	no_emotion
speaker	I hate dentists .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	no_emotion
speaker	It always hurts . I hate going .	no_emotion
speaker	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	no_emotion
speaker	O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .	no_emotion
speaker	Good . You'll feel better after you do .	no_emotion

speaker	Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .	no_emotion
speaker	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .	no_emotion
speaker	How long does it take to get there ?	no_emotion
speaker	About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .	no_emotion
speaker	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .	no_emotion
speaker	Great ! I ’ ll take it .	happiness
speaker	Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !	no_emotion
speaker	I understand . Thank you very much !	no_emotion
speaker	Have a great trip .	happiness

speaker	I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .	no_emotion
speaker	A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?	no_emotion
speaker	The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .	no_emotion
speaker	So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?	no_emotion
speaker	It sounds like it will be .	no_emotion
speaker	I really hope it doesn't get cold .	no_emotion
speaker	That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .	no_emotion
speaker	The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .	no_emotion
speaker	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .	no_emotion
speaker	It would be nice if the weather would never change .	no_emotion
speaker	That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .	no_emotion
speaker	True . Predictable weather would make life easier .	no_emotion

speaker	Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .	no_emotion
speaker	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .	no_emotion
speaker	Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	no_emotion
speaker	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	no_emotion
speaker	I doubt that .	no_emotion

speaker	Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	no_emotion
speaker	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	no_emotion
speaker	You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .	no_emotion
speaker	What's special about these things ?	no_emotion
speaker	Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	no_emotion
speaker	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .	happiness

speaker	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .	sadness
speaker	You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .	sadness
speaker	Is that so ?	surprise
speaker	Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .	no_emotion
speaker	Have you decided ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . I want to get a better job .	no_emotion
speaker	Could you tell me why you want to quit ?	no_emotion
speaker	I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .	no_emotion
speaker	OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you so much for your advice .	no_emotion
speaker	And every best wish for your new job .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	no_emotion

speaker	The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?	no_emotion
speaker	Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .	no_emotion
speaker	Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .	no_emotion
speaker	Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .	no_emotion
speaker	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .	no_emotion
speaker	All right .	no_emotion

speaker	So , how should we get to the theatre ?	no_emotion
speaker	Let's take the bus .	no_emotion
speaker	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .	anger
speaker	It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .	no_emotion
speaker	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .	anger
speaker	We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .	no_emotion
speaker	Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .	no_emotion
speaker	If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?	no_emotion
speaker	We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .	no_emotion
speaker	Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .	no_emotion
speaker	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .	no_emotion
speaker	Thanks , that was nice of you .	happiness
speaker	See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !	no_emotion

speaker	Let's go over this plan again .	no_emotion
speaker	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .	no_emotion
speaker	And that is mostly flat , right ?	no_emotion
speaker	Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .	no_emotion
speaker	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?	no_emotion
speaker	That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .	no_emotion
speaker	It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .	no_emotion
speaker	Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?	no_emotion

speaker	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .	anger
speaker	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .	no_emotion
speaker	Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .	no_emotion
speaker	No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .	no_emotion
speaker	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .	no_emotion
speaker	Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .	no_emotion

speaker	It's time for bed .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .	no_emotion
speaker	It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .	no_emotion
speaker	Why don't you try counting sheep ?	no_emotion
speaker	I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .	no_emotion
speaker	That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .	no_emotion
speaker	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?	no_emotion
speaker	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .	no_emotion
speaker	I promise I'll go to sleep soon .	no_emotion
speaker	No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .	no_emotion
speaker	See you in the morning .	happiness

speaker	I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .	no_emotion
speaker	How about your psychological resilience ?	no_emotion
speaker	I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .	no_emotion
speaker	How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?	no_emotion
speaker	I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .	no_emotion
speaker	You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .	no_emotion
speaker	Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .	no_emotion
speaker	I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .	no_emotion

speaker	Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .	no_emotion
speaker	Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?	no_emotion
speaker	I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .	no_emotion
speaker	Fine . At 3:30 ?	no_emotion

speaker	I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .	happiness
speaker	Nice meeting you , too .	happiness

speaker	I made my little brother cry .	no_emotion
speaker	Shame on you !	anger

speaker	I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?	no_emotion
speaker	Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .	no_emotion
speaker	Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?	no_emotion
speaker	We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .	no_emotion
speaker	I can help you with that .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	happiness

speaker	Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , we are on the same plane .	no_emotion
speaker	But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .	no_emotion
speaker	So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .	no_emotion
speaker	Why not go and find a porter ?	no_emotion

speaker	Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .	no_emotion
speaker	But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !	no_emotion
speaker	You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?	no_emotion
speaker	I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .	no_emotion
speaker	It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?	no_emotion
speaker	I bashed it against the chair in my room .	no_emotion
speaker	Does it hurt ?	no_emotion
speaker	A little , but not much .	no_emotion
speaker	Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .	no_emotion
speaker	If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?	no_emotion
speaker	If you are better , but I doubt you will be .	no_emotion

speaker	This is your schedule .	no_emotion
speaker	You're going out of your way for us , I believe .	happiness
speaker	You are our honored guests .	happiness

speaker	Are there any vacancies still available ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . We need a plumber here .	no_emotion
speaker	I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .	no_emotion
speaker	I am sorry . They are not available now .	no_emotion

speaker	My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .	happiness
speaker	Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?	no_emotion
speaker	Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?	happiness
speaker	There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .	no_emotion
speaker	The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?	no_emotion
speaker	You know , that is one of my favorites !	happiness
speaker	OK , I'll take one order of that .	no_emotion
speaker	You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .	no_emotion
speaker	Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .	happiness

speaker	I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .	sadness
speaker	What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?	no_emotion
speaker	Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .	no_emotion

speaker	I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .	no_emotion
speaker	What would you like to speak to me about ?	no_emotion
speaker	I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .	no_emotion

speaker	I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .	no_emotion
speaker	That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .	no_emotion
speaker	I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .	no_emotion
speaker	That ’ s fantastic .	no_emotion
speaker	Are you planning on voting ?	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m going to vote .	no_emotion

speaker	We look forward to your settlement at an early date .	no_emotion
speaker	We will inform you as soon as possible .	no_emotion

speaker	Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?	no_emotion
speaker	Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .	no_emotion
speaker	Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?	no_emotion
speaker	At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .	no_emotion
speaker	Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .	happiness
speaker	Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .	happiness
speaker	I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .	no_emotion
speaker	OK , let's go .	no_emotion

speaker	Where on earth are we ?	no_emotion
speaker	Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .	no_emotion
speaker	What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .	no_emotion
speaker	It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .	no_emotion

speaker	Hello . Front desk .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .	no_emotion
speaker	Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?	no_emotion
speaker	Is it possible to change to another room ?	no_emotion
speaker	Could you please tell me why ?	no_emotion
speaker	My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .	no_emotion
speaker	So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .	no_emotion
speaker	You ’ re right .	no_emotion
speaker	Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?	no_emotion
speaker	That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?	no_emotion
speaker	Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , thank you kindly .	happiness
speaker	You ’ re welcome .	happiness

speaker	How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?	no_emotion
speaker	Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .	no_emotion
speaker	Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .	no_emotion
speaker	No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .	no_emotion

speaker	Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .	no_emotion
speaker	Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , nothing in particular .	no_emotion
speaker	You may ask questions about us , if you have any .	no_emotion
speaker	All right . When can I start ?	no_emotion

speaker	What are you doing here today ?	no_emotion
speaker	I would like to fight my ticket .	no_emotion
speaker	Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , the officer is here today .	no_emotion
speaker	What's your case ?	no_emotion
speaker	I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .	no_emotion
speaker	Do you believe that the officer lied ?	no_emotion
speaker	There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .	no_emotion
speaker	Your license plate was caught on camera ?	no_emotion
speaker	A picture of my license plate was never taken .	no_emotion
speaker	Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .	happiness

speaker	Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?	no_emotion
speaker	Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .	no_emotion
speaker	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .	no_emotion
speaker	That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .	no_emotion
speaker	What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .	no_emotion
speaker	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .	no_emotion
speaker	After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .	no_emotion

speaker	what shall we do after the volleyball match ?	no_emotion
speaker	how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .	no_emotion
speaker	that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .	happiness
speaker	me , too . What did you have in mind ?	no_emotion
speaker	I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .	no_emotion
speaker	I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .	happiness
speaker	is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?	no_emotion
speaker	the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .	no_emotion
speaker	oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .	no_emotion
speaker	any other ideas ?	no_emotion
speaker	there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .	no_emotion
speaker	it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .	happiness

speaker	Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !	anger
speaker	You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .	no_emotion
speaker	Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !	no_emotion
speaker	No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .	no_emotion
speaker	But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !	anger
speaker	You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?	no_emotion
speaker	Thanks mom !	happiness

speaker	It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .	no_emotion
speaker	It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?	no_emotion
speaker	Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .	no_emotion
speaker	That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .	no_emotion
speaker	The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .	no_emotion
speaker	Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .	no_emotion
speaker	Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .	no_emotion
speaker	Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .	happiness

speaker	Is the factory fully-automated ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .	no_emotion
speaker	What about supply of parts to the production line ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .	no_emotion
speaker	What about the smaller components ?	no_emotion
speaker	They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .	no_emotion

speaker	I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .	happiness
speaker	Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .	no_emotion
speaker	That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .	no_emotion
speaker	I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?	no_emotion
speaker	Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .	no_emotion
speaker	Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .	no_emotion

speaker	What does your job involve ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .	no_emotion

speaker	Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .	sadness
speaker	Did you have hotel card or something ?	no_emotion
speaker	Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?	no_emotion

speaker	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?	happiness
speaker	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .	no_emotion
speaker	So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .	no_emotion
speaker	How long did it take you to do the tiling .	no_emotion
speaker	As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .	no_emotion
speaker	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?	happiness
speaker	You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .	happiness

speaker	I'd like to see that pen , please .	no_emotion
speaker	You mean this one ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , the other one in the brown case .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , this one ... Here .	no_emotion
speaker	May I try it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Sure .	no_emotion
speaker	It's very smooth . I'll take it .	no_emotion
speaker	Cash or charge ?	no_emotion
speaker	Charge , please .	no_emotion

speaker	I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .	no_emotion
speaker	We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .	no_emotion
speaker	Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .	no_emotion
speaker	But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .	no_emotion
speaker	I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .	no_emotion
speaker	There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .	no_emotion

speaker	You can also check out university bulletin boards .	no_emotion
speaker	Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .	happiness
speaker	Good luck .	happiness

speaker	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !	anger
speaker	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .	no_emotion
speaker	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .	anger
speaker	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .	no_emotion
speaker	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .	anger
speaker	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .	anger
speaker	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .	no_emotion
speaker	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?	disgust
speaker	I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .	no_emotion

speaker	hey , you look great ! how's everything ?	no_emotion
speaker	yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .	no_emotion
speaker	really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .	no_emotion
speaker	it's important to do proper exercises .	no_emotion
speaker	you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	no_emotion
speaker	the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	no_emotion
speaker	sounds reasonable .	no_emotion
speaker	we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .	no_emotion
speaker	and fruits !	no_emotion
speaker	surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .	no_emotion
speaker	I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?	no_emotion
speaker	yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .	no_emotion

speaker	what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?	no_emotion
speaker	while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .	no_emotion
speaker	why not ?	no_emotion
speaker	the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !	no_emotion
speaker	it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .	no_emotion
speaker	I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .	no_emotion
speaker	I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .	no_emotion
speaker	all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .	no_emotion
speaker	perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .	no_emotion
speaker	I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .	no_emotion
speaker	that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .	no_emotion
speaker	you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .	no_emotion

speaker	That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?	no_emotion
speaker	A dressy party would be fun !	no_emotion
speaker	That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?	no_emotion
speaker	We should probably have both .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?	no_emotion
speaker	Maybe we could do both !	no_emotion

speaker	How did your company's fundraiser go ?	no_emotion
speaker	The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .	no_emotion
speaker	So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?	no_emotion
speaker	Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .	no_emotion
speaker	Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	no_emotion
speaker	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .	no_emotion

speaker	My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl	no_emotion
speaker	Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?	no_emotion
speaker	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .	no_emotion
speaker	Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?	no_emotion
speaker	No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy	no_emotion

speaker	Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .	no_emotion
speaker	So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?	no_emotion
speaker	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .	no_emotion
speaker	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?	happiness
speaker	No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .	no_emotion
speaker	You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .	no_emotion

speaker	Take your time .	no_emotion
speaker	I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .	no_emotion
speaker	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .	no_emotion
speaker	The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .	no_emotion
speaker	When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .	no_emotion
speaker	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?	no_emotion
speaker	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .	no_emotion
speaker	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?	no_emotion
speaker	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?	no_emotion
speaker	Very well , I will .	no_emotion

speaker	Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .	no_emotion
speaker	Is there any flexibility on that ?	no_emotion
speaker	Unfortunately , not .	no_emotion
speaker	OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .	no_emotion
speaker	Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .	no_emotion

speaker	Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .	no_emotion

speaker	Sure , do you have the receipt ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?	no_emotion
speaker	The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .	no_emotion
speaker	I see , and what about the keyboard ?	no_emotion
speaker	I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .	no_emotion
speaker	I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .	sadness
speaker	Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .	anger

speaker	There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !	no_emotion
speaker	Luckily we got the last two .	no_emotion
speaker	Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !	surprise
speaker	Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .	no_emotion
speaker	I really admire those who made such great inventions !	no_emotion
speaker	May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .	no_emotion
speaker	They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .	no_emotion
speaker	Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .	surprise
speaker	Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .	no_emotion
speaker	No , quite the contrary .	no_emotion
speaker	Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .	no_emotion

speaker	What can I do for you ?	no_emotion
speaker	I need some medicine .	no_emotion

speaker	Do you believe in god ?	no_emotion
speaker	Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?	no_emotion
speaker	I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .	no_emotion
speaker	I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .	no_emotion
speaker	I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .	no_emotion
speaker	For example ?	no_emotion
speaker	Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .	no_emotion

speaker	Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?	no_emotion

speaker	You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .	happiness

speaker	What a terrible house !	anger
speaker	I'm sick of it , too .	no_emotion
speaker	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .	anger
speaker	It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .	no_emotion
speaker	Sure .	no_emotion

speaker	That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?	no_emotion
speaker	Do you have any special request ?	no_emotion
speaker	I'd like to see some traditional arts .	no_emotion
speaker	So that means you are shopping for presents ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .	no_emotion
speaker	Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .	no_emotion
speaker	Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .	happiness
speaker	I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .	no_emotion
speaker	You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .	no_emotion

speaker	Yes .	no_emotion
speaker	OK . Let me try again .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	happiness

speaker	Did you ever get a parking ticket ?	no_emotion
speaker	Only a few .	no_emotion
speaker	What's a few ?	no_emotion
speaker	I've gotten six , I think .	no_emotion
speaker	Did you pay your fines ?	no_emotion
speaker	Of course I have .	no_emotion
speaker	How much are the parking tickets ?	no_emotion
speaker	I think they're $ 130 .	no_emotion
speaker	That's expensive .	no_emotion
speaker	I just got a parking ticket .	no_emotion

speaker	I'm going to pay it today .	no_emotion

speaker	Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?	no_emotion
speaker	I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?	no_emotion
speaker	Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?	no_emotion
speaker	Is it urgent ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok , I am coming .	no_emotion
speaker	Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .	no_emotion
speaker	All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .	no_emotion
speaker	Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .	no_emotion
speaker	Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .	no_emotion
speaker	You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?	no_emotion
speaker	Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .	no_emotion

speaker	You're finally here ! What took so long ?	happiness
speaker	I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .	no_emotion
speaker	It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .	no_emotion
speaker	perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .	no_emotion
speaker	I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .	no_emotion
speaker	It would be better for the environment , too .	no_emotion
speaker	I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .	no_emotion
speaker	Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .	no_emotion
speaker	The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .	no_emotion
speaker	That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !	happiness
speaker	So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .	no_emotion

speaker	That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .	no_emotion
speaker	I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .	no_emotion
speaker	That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .	no_emotion
speaker	Sure , for at least three thousand per month .	no_emotion
speaker	That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .	happiness

speaker	Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?	no_emotion

speaker	I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .	sadness
speaker	Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , we'll do so .	no_emotion

speaker	Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?	no_emotion

speaker	I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?	no_emotion
speaker	The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?	no_emotion
speaker	That's fine , thank you .	happiness

speaker	Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue .	no_emotion

speaker	It seems that many boys are fighting there .	no_emotion
speaker	Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .	anger

speaker	the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !	anger
speaker	exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .	no_emotion
speaker	on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .	anger
speaker	as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .	no_emotion
speaker	I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse	no_emotion
speaker	what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?	no_emotion
speaker	it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .	no_emotion
speaker	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?	no_emotion
speaker	they're related to one another , yes .	no_emotion
speaker	I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .	no_emotion
speaker	people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .	no_emotion
speaker	people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .	no_emotion
speaker	I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .	no_emotion

speaker	It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .	no_emotion
speaker	You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .	no_emotion
speaker	Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .	no_emotion
speaker	I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?	no_emotion
speaker	That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .	no_emotion
speaker	These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .	happiness

speaker	Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .	no_emotion
speaker	I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .	no_emotion
speaker	But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .	no_emotion
speaker	Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .	no_emotion
speaker	Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .	anger

speaker	Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .	no_emotion
speaker	But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .	no_emotion
speaker	But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , only you liked it really , darling .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .	no_emotion

speaker	Hi , Bob , everything okay ?	no_emotion
speaker	More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .	no_emotion
speaker	Oh ? What's that ?	surprise
speaker	Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .	no_emotion
speaker	What gift ?	no_emotion
speaker	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .	no_emotion
speaker	You refused the gift ? That's terrible .	surprise
speaker	I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .	no_emotion
speaker	Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .	no_emotion
speaker	That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .	no_emotion

speaker	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .	no_emotion
speaker	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?	no_emotion
speaker	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .	no_emotion
speaker	Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !	no_emotion
speaker	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .	no_emotion
speaker	That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .	no_emotion
speaker	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?	no_emotion

speaker	Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?	no_emotion
speaker	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .	no_emotion
speaker	Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .	no_emotion
speaker	Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .	no_emotion
speaker	Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !	surprise
speaker	Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .	sadness
speaker	Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .	no_emotion

speaker	Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .	no_emotion
speaker	So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .	no_emotion
speaker	How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?	no_emotion
speaker	I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .	no_emotion
speaker	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .	no_emotion
speaker	I think that we should leave 10 % .	no_emotion
speaker	$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .	no_emotion

speaker	Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .	no_emotion
speaker	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !	surprise
speaker	Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .	no_emotion

speaker	I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .	no_emotion
speaker	It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes .	no_emotion
speaker	Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .	no_emotion
speaker	What do you suggest ?	no_emotion
speaker	The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .	no_emotion
speaker	You mean because people have to go across town to get here .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .	no_emotion
speaker	That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .	no_emotion
speaker	I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .	no_emotion
speaker	I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .	no_emotion
speaker	Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .	no_emotion
speaker	Well .	no_emotion
speaker	I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .	no_emotion
speaker	You mean you want to run the meetings ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .	no_emotion
speaker	Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .	no_emotion
speaker	I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .	no_emotion
speaker	I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .	no_emotion
speaker	Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .	happiness
speaker	I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "	no_emotion

speaker	The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !	surprise

speaker	Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?	no_emotion

speaker	I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .	no_emotion
speaker	I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .	no_emotion
speaker	Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .	no_emotion

speaker	A ticket to London , please .	no_emotion
speaker	A cheap day return ticket ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , including London Tube .	no_emotion
speaker	That'll be twelve pounds .	no_emotion

speaker	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .	anger

speaker	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .	no_emotion
speaker	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .	no_emotion

speaker	I never have seasonal allergies .	no_emotion
speaker	Consider yourself lucky .	no_emotion
speaker	What are all the symptoms ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .	no_emotion
speaker	That doesn't sound good .	no_emotion
speaker	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?	no_emotion
speaker	Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .	no_emotion
speaker	Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .	no_emotion
speaker	I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .	no_emotion
speaker	That's pretty bad .	no_emotion
speaker	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .	happiness

speaker	Let's have a look at the map first .	no_emotion
speaker	All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .	no_emotion
speaker	Let's buy some tickets .	no_emotion
speaker	The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train	no_emotion

speaker	I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?	no_emotion
speaker	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .	no_emotion
speaker	Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .	no_emotion
speaker	What about cats ? They are more independent .	no_emotion
speaker	Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .	no_emotion
speaker	How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yeah , are they easy to look after ?	no_emotion
speaker	Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .	no_emotion

speaker	There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?	no_emotion
speaker	No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .	no_emotion
speaker	I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .	no_emotion
speaker	So , we'd like to see some embroidery .	no_emotion

speaker	Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?	no_emotion
speaker	I had some bread for breakfast .	no_emotion
speaker	Let's go out for brunch .	no_emotion
speaker	Brunch ?	no_emotion
speaker	It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .	no_emotion
speaker	Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .	no_emotion

speaker	That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .	no_emotion
speaker	They might be too hot for me .	no_emotion
speaker	Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .	no_emotion
speaker	What about any special Beijing dishes ?	no_emotion

speaker	Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?	no_emotion

speaker	didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .	no_emotion
speaker	how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	surprise
speaker	if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	no_emotion
speaker	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	surprise
speaker	he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	no_emotion
speaker	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	no_emotion
speaker	they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	no_emotion
speaker	that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	no_emotion
speaker	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	no_emotion
speaker	regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	no_emotion
speaker	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	no_emotion
speaker	let's hope so .	no_emotion

speaker	You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?	happiness
speaker	Sounds good . May I have a look ?	happiness
speaker	Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .	happiness
speaker	They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .	no_emotion
speaker	All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .	happiness
speaker	Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?	no_emotion
speaker	This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .	no_emotion
speaker	Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .	no_emotion
speaker	OK , I will wrap them for you .	happiness

speaker	Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .	no_emotion
speaker	Do you have a particular style in mind ?	no_emotion
speaker	The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .	no_emotion
speaker	I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .	no_emotion
speaker	I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .	no_emotion
speaker	The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?	no_emotion
speaker	Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?	happiness
speaker	Next Friday .	no_emotion
speaker	Thank you .	happiness

speaker	Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .	no_emotion
speaker	Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .	no_emotion
speaker	I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .	no_emotion
speaker	Good luck to us .	no_emotion

speaker	Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !	no_emotion

speaker	Every Saturday and Sunday	no_emotion

speaker	Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .	happiness

speaker	I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .	no_emotion
speaker	We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .	no_emotion
speaker	I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .	no_emotion
speaker	We need to find a good realtor .	no_emotion
speaker	Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .	no_emotion
speaker	What do you mean ?	no_emotion
speaker	Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .	no_emotion
speaker	But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .	no_emotion
speaker	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .	no_emotion
speaker	I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has	no_emotion
speaker	Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .	no_emotion
speaker	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?	no_emotion
speaker	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .	no_emotion
speaker	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?	no_emotion
speaker	Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .	no_emotion
speaker	Why ?	surprise
speaker	Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .	no_emotion
speaker	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .	no_emotion
speaker	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .	no_emotion
speaker	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .	no_emotion
speaker	Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .	no_emotion

speaker	I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .	no_emotion

speaker	It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .	no_emotion
speaker	I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .	no_emotion

speaker	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...	no_emotion
speaker	We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	no_emotion
speaker	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .	no_emotion

speaker	I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .	no_emotion
speaker	Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?	no_emotion
speaker	Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !	no_emotion

speaker	That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .	no_emotion

speaker	I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .	no_emotion
